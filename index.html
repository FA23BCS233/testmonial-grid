        <h5>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in company I
          joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h5>

        <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have
          heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
          increadibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 week was the best - and most grueling - time of my
          life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Enigineer at a VR
          startup."</p>

        <h5>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h5>

        <p>"I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big
          company. This was one of the best investments I've made in myself."</p>

        <h5>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves Getting guidance from them and learning
          from their experiences was easy</h5>

        <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the
          confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable jonior developer. The
          standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an increadible community of
          smart and amazing people."</p>

        <h5>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h5>

        <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
          who can help me learn programming step-by-step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former sturdent of theirs who
          can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
          very hands-on and I never had to wait for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
          It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred
          to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
          full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!</p>
